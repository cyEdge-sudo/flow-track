- Authentication and roles: Provide user registration, login, and logout, with two roles (User and Manager). Managers can create and manage their team by associating users to themselves, and each user is linked to a single manager for reporting visibility.

- Task management and sharing: Enable users to create, edit, and complete tasks with core fields (title, description, due date, status). Allow task sharing with specific users so collaborators can view and update status and notes, while the task owner can control and revoke sharing.

- Daily user nudges (3 per day): Send three reminders per day to each user prompting them to review and update their tasks. The nudge schedule is configurable (with sensible defaults), and each nudge highlights due and overdue tasks and records whether the user acknowledged or updated their tasks.

- Daily manager reports: Deliver a daily summary to each manager covering their team’s activity, including per-user counts of tasks completed today, open tasks, overdue tasks, and tasks due soon (e.g., next day). Reports are sent at a consistent time and also available in an in-app reporting view.

- Dashboards: Provide a user dashboard to view own and shared tasks, progress, and upcoming nudges, and a manager dashboard to view team members, their task summaries, daily reports, and the ability to share tasks with or across team members.
